# 👋 Hi, I'm Ahmed Ezzat

🎮 **Software Engineer | Node.js, TypeScript, C# Developer | (Hopefully) C++ Developer 😄 | Game Dev**

I build systems that blend **gameplay engineering**, **C++ architecture**, and **performance-oriented design**.  
This portfolio collects selected projects that demonstrate my focus on **ECS architecture**, **multithreading**, and **core system design** in modern C++.

Concepts utilized in making the prototype:
- Modular assets
- Collision channels and detection
- Custom components for grabbing world objects, triggering actions on detecting overlaps, and moving actors
- Physics handlers
- Light sources

### 🎮 [ECS Game Framework (C++ / SDL3)](ECS/README.md)
> A modular **Entity-Component-System** framework written in modern **C++20**, currently evolving toward a fully data-driven design.

Key features:
- Core ECS with component storage and entity signatures
- Systems for movement, rendering, AI, and events
- Integration with **SDL3** for rendering and input
- JSON-based **data-driven entity loading**
- Designed for gameplay extensibility and experimentation

### 🎮 [Football simulation server (C++) (WIP)](https://github.com/mido1236/portfolio/tree/master/football_server)
> A simple football/soccer simulation server based on the [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets) library that accepts inputs from clients and advances their positions according to their attributes.

Key features:
- Systems for web sockets, matches and inputs
- JSON-based communication
- Parsing of binary data for client inputs
- Utilizing Google Test framework for unit tests

---

### ⚙️ [Thread Pool Executor (C++)](https://github.com/mido1236/portfolio/tree/main/Projects/ThreadPoolExecutor)
> A simple, efficient **C++ thread pool** implementation built to explore concurrency primitives and task distribution.

Highlights:
- Fixed-size thread pool managing queued tasks
- Uses modern C++ concurrency (`std::thread`, `std::condition_variable`)
- Demonstrates safe task scheduling and worker synchronization
- Lightweight, educational implementation for engine-side multithreading

🧩 Technologies: `C++20`, `STL`, `Threading`, `Synchronization`

### 🧠 [JPEG style Image Compression Tool (C++)](https://github.com/mido1236/portfolio/tree/master/Projects/JPEGHuffmanImageCompressor)
> A custom implementation of **Huffman coding** and **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)** for image compression.

Features:
- Encodes grayscale bitmaps using Huffman entropy coding
- Applies Forward and Inverse DCT with quantization
- Reconstructs compressed images from frequency-domain data
- Clear, step-by-step implementation mimicking the JPEG pipeline

🧩 Technologies: `C++17`, `DCT`, `Huffman Coding`, `Quantization`
